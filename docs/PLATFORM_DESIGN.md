## 1. Current State Summary

### What Exists Today

| Feature Area | Trainee | Trainer/Admin |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Authentication | OTP login (email/phone) | Same |
| Dashboard | Stats overview, player card, quick actions | Aggregate stats, recent activity |
| Forms | Pre-workout, post-workout, nutrition (one-time) | View all submissions (read-only) |

### What's Missing (Key Gaps)

**Onboarding**
- [x] ~~No profile completion flow (birthdate, position, goals)~~ ✅ DONE - Profile completion implemented
- [ ] No welcome wizard or guided tour
- [ ] No clear "Join Academy" CTA on landing page

**Progress & Feedback**
- [x] ~~No trend visualizations (charts/graphs over time)~~ ✅ DONE - Progress charts with date filtering
- [x] ~~No goal setting or target tracking~~ ✅ DONE - Goals system with trainer management
- [x] ~~No comparison to peers (percentile rankings)~~ ✅ DONE - Age group percentile rankings
- [x] ~~No achievement/gamification system~~ ✅ DONE - Achievement badges with 19 badge types

**Communication**
- [ ] No messaging between trainers and trainees
- [ ] No notifications when assessments added
- [ ] No feedback loop on forms

**Admin Tools**
- [x] ~~No user editing (roles, details)~~ ✅ DONE - Admin user editing with activity logs
- [ ] No filtering, search, or export
- [ ] No analytics dashboard

- Don't know what metrics mean
- No personalized feedback from trainers
- ~~Forms are tedious, no draft saving~~ ✅ Draft saving implemented

### Persona 2: **Trainer (מאמן)**
**Who**: Academy coaches who run training sessions
**Goals**:

- Communicate feedback to players

**Pain Points Today**:
- Assessment form has all tests on one page (too long)
- No quick view of who needs assessments
- Can't easily compare players
- No way to message players

### Persona 3: **Admin (מנהל)**
**Who**: Academy management
**Goals**:
- Overview of entire program
- User management (roles, access)
- Analytics and reporting
- Export data for reports

**Pain Points Today**:
- Can't edit user roles

## 8. Design Decisions (Confirmed)

The following decisions have been confirmed:

### Core Decisions (Round 1)

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Assessment Flow** | Minimum required (Date + 1 category) | Flexibility for trainers to complete what's available |
| **Rankings** | Show rankings | Display position in age group - motivating for competitive players |
| **Goals System** | Trainers only | Trainers set goals - ensures realistic targets |
| **Video Tracking** | Just opened (current) | Mark as watched when modal opens - simple approach |
| **Profile Photos** | Yes, add photos | Upload during onboarding - shows on FIFA-style player card |
| **Form Editing** | No editing allowed | Once submitted, cannot be changed (maintain data integrity) |
| **Notifications** | Skip for now | Focus on core features first, add notifications later |
| **Data Export** | Skip for now | Not needed for initial launch |

### Technical Decisions (Round 2)

| Question | Decision | Details |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Photo Upload Size** | 2MB max | Good balance of quality and performance |
| **Photo Cropping** | Shoulder-and-above cutout | User crops to show shoulders and head (portrait style) |
| **Progress Chart Ranges** | 3m, 6m, 1yr, All | Multiple options for different viewing needs |
| **Streak Counting** | Form OR video | Any form submission or video watched counts toward streak |
| **Step Navigation** | Free navigation | Trainers can go back and edit any step before finishing |
| **Assessment Resume** | Auto-save, resume later | Each step saves to DB, incomplete assessments show "continue" option |
| **Tie Handling** | Same rank | All tied players show same position (e.g., 3 players at #2) |
| **No Assessment State** | Hidden card | Don't show FIFA card until first assessment exists |

### Updated Priority Based on Decisions

**Phase 1: Core** ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ Step-by-step assessment (with minimum completion rule) - DONE
2. ✅ Profile completion with photo upload - DONE
3. ✅ Progress charts with age group rankings - DONE

**Phase 2: Enhancement (In Progress)**
4. Admin user role editing - NEXT
5. Goals system (trainer-managed)
6. Form draft saving

**Deferred:**
- Notifications system
- Data export
- Form editing capability

  current_value DECIMAL(10,3),
  is_lower_better BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- true for sprint times
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
